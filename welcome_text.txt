Hi and welcome to the organizing channel. This channel houses conversations that helps keep Civic Tech Toronto, and the hacknights we all enjoy, running smoothly...well most of the time. We - the organizers - are now keeping it open for the entire community to see. So if there's anything you want to help with, just pipe up and we'd love to get your support. Thanks and welcome!

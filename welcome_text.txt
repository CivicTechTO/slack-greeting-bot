:ctto: Hi and welcome to the organizing channel! We’re glad you’re here :tada:

This channel houses conversations that helps keep Civic Tech Toronto, and the hacknights we all enjoy, running smoothly... well, most of the time :wink: .

We, the organizers, have opened this channel up for the entire community to see and participate. So if there's anything you want to help with, just pipe up and we'd love to get your support.

Thanks and welcome! :raised_hands::spock-hand:
